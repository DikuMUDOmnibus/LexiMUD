a large marble fountain sets at the center of this room~
A large marble fountain of unworldly beauty.~
As you walk around the fountain you note the fine craftmanship and many hours
that went into its creation.  Four female statues, all of unsurpassing beauty
are placed in a circular pattern.  From each urn carried by the women water
flows and cascades into the water basin below.  You feel an inner peace as you
gaze into the eyes of the statues perched atop this marvelous fountain.
